# Circuit Timer

A simple timer application for tracking circuit training workouts. This is mostly a place for me to play around with TypeScript and React. Try it out the [Demo](jrmeier.github.io/circuit-timer)!

It can also be installed as a PWA on your phone. On iOS, you can add it to your home screen by clicking the share button and selecting "Add to Home Screen".
